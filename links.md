4. [Mounting a disk in Unix](https://osp4diss.vlsm.org/W03-03.html) - This is the page that can tell us how to mount a drive in Unix. Since we're starting to utilize a new disk and we need to mount it everytime we reboot if we need it, this link could come in handy.
5. [Little and Big Endian in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/little-and-big-endian-mystery/) - This page contains information regarding little and big endian in the C language. Since week 4 is starting to touch on the subject of data adresses, and consequently endians, I think and I hope that his link can help.
6. [Virtual Memory in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/) - This page contains information about virtual memory. This week, specifically week 5, we're currently learning about virtual memories, so I think it's appropriate to have a link that elaborates further on this topic, and it might come in handy in future situations whether it's for a quiz or just learning in general.
7. [Fork System Call](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fork-system-call/) - This page in my opinion has an excellent explanation and demonstration of how fork() works. Not only does it explain what fork() is and how it works, it also shows you demonstrations of codes that uses fork(). This page personally helped me understand fork() a lot better than what I previously understood.

9. [Linux Beginner's Guide to Installing from Source](http://moi.vonos.net/linux/beginners-installing-from-source/) - This link is provided in the LFS website, but I think this link is going to be relevant enough not just for future and current assignments, but also for general knowledge since I'm a Linux beginner myself.

[Overview of Mass Storage Structure](https://padakuu.com/article/175-overview-of-mass-storage-structure) - For week 9, we are learning about mass storage structures which discusses about physical disks, it's disck-scheduling algorithm, etc. This link, as it's name suggests, is an overview of that topic. I hope that this link can provide additional insight.
